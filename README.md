Hashtag-Search 
==============
This project is a Flask Web Application that supports login and register validation with a SQL Alchemy Database. Then, Selenium is used as a Web Scrapping library to search a hashtag that the user wants, and it is going to show the hashtags that are recommended for the user's use.

For the use of this application the next modules should be installed: 
- Flask 
- flask_sqlalchemy 
- flask_WTForms 
- SQLalchemy 
- flask_login 
- flask_session 
- selenium 

This is one of the my first projects that was definitely more complex than others working with Flask. Connecting the implementation of Flask with the bot management witH Selenium was a learning curve for me. 

In order for Selenium to work, the latest Chrome WebDriver must be download and installed in your PC. Inside the recommendedBot.py file, the chrome driver path should me updated for the path inside the user's computer.

Some of the UI of the project can be seen below:
